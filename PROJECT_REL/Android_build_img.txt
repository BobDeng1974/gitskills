# Boot image for the i.MX 6Dual/6Quad SABRE-SD board
$ cd ~/myandroid
$ source build/envsetup.sh
$ lunch sabresd_6dq-user
$ make bootimage



The default configuration in the source code package takes internal eMMC as the boot storage. It can be changed to make the
SD card in SD Slot 3 as the boot storage as follows:
1. Remove /out/target/product/sabresd_6dq/root directory and boot*.img.
2. Remove /out/target/product/sabresd_6dq/recovery directory and recovery*.img.
3. Build the boot.img and recovery.img as follows:
make bootimage BUILD_TARGET_DEVICE=sd
make recoveryimage BUILD_TARGET_DEVICE=sd
